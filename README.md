# git-cl

is a tool to generate a changelog. It works by passing a list of commit messages either through a file
or through stdin. Those will get parsed and outputted as a changelog.

## Usage

Pass a list of commit messages (just the subject) via stdin. They will be transformed to a Markdownfile.

Usage example:

    git log --pretty=format:"%s" | go run main.go

### Grouping

In terms of conventional commits the types are mapped to groups like this:

| Type | Group        |
|---|--------------|
|feat| Feature      |
|fix| Bugfix       |
|doc| Other        |
|chore| Other        |
|refactor| Optimization |
|test| Optimization |
|style| Usability    |
|perf| Optimization |
|other| Other        |

Header is currently a first level headline named `Changelog`.
Footer is currently the text `generated by git-cl`

### Structure of the markdown file

The markdown file consists of a header, the body and the footer. Content besides data derived from the commits
is currently hardcoded.

    HEADER
    
    BODY
    
    FOOTER

Body iterates over the groups and lists the commits for each one
